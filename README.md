# slugger

Simple wrapper classes that allow _"slug-based"_ access to data in multi-dimensional arrays or objects.
Alongside with slug access, type checking when writing new data is enforced, and it's possible to lock the data to prevent any future changes.

This repo is still very much a work in progress, so don't use any of the code just yet.
